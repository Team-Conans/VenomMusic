/*About the Tutorial

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level 

programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985 – 1990. Like 
Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
Python is named after a TV Show called ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ and not after 
Python-the snake.
Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Although this version is supposed to be backward 
incompatibles, later on many of its important features have been backported to be 
compatible with the version 2.7. This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python 3 
version programming language. Please refer to this link for our Python 2 tutorial.
Audience
This tutorial is designed for software programmers who want to upgrade their Python skills 
to Python 3. This tutorial can also be used to learn Python programming language from 
scratch.
Prerequisites
You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic 
understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.
Execute Python Programs
For most of the examples given in this tutorial you will find Try it option, so just make use 
of it and enjoy your learning.
Try the following example using Try it option available at the top right corner of the below 
sample code box −
#!/usr/bin/python3

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string
>>> x

'10'

>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string including ''
>>> x
"'10'"
In Python 3
>>> x=input("something:")
something:10
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''
>>> x
"'10'"
>>> x=raw_input("something:") # will result NameError
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
x=raw_input("something:")
NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the

other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.


Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.
xrange() Function Removed
In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 
the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.
xrange() Function Removed
In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 
the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .

next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.

2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.
xrange() Function Removed
In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 
the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x
print a
return a
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 
Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the
other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and

except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0


Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x
print a
return a
xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.

The __future__ module

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x

>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
>>> x

'10'

>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string including ''
>>> x
"'10'"
In Python 3
>>> x=input("something:")
something:10
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''
>>> x
"'10'"
>>> x=raw_input("something:") # will result NameError
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
x=raw_input("something:")
NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.

The __future__ module

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the

other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.

xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.

def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the

other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
>>> x

The __future__ module

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string
>>> x

'10'

>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string including ''
>>> x
"'10'"
In Python 3
>>> x=input("something:")
something:10
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''
>>> x

Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
The __future__ module
Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 
imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the

other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.


xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.

Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 

Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the

other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.

xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.

def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 
Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the
other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.

Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with 
the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
xrange() Function Removed

the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications 
from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the 
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, 
Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although 
Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.

Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible 
with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate 
programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and 
preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of 
Python 3.

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''

xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3

2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 
Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the
other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other 
languages.

Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do 
not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and 
PHP.


the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique 
of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python 3.
The __future__ module

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
xrange() Function Removed
In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 
the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x
print a
return a
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=raw_input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string including ''
>>> x
"'10'"
In Python 3
>>> x=input("something:")
something:10
>>> x
'10'
>>> x=input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''
>>> x

The __future__ module

Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 

imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
xrange() Function Removed
In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 
the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3

except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.

Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
The __future__ module
Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 
imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string

Integer Division
In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a 
result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or 
denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will 
result in 1.5
Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.
Unicode Representation
Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 
byte classes: byte and byte arrays.
xrange() Function Removed

In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate 

the items in the range when needed, saving memory.
In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). 
In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later .
raise exceprion
Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a 
SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
Arguments in Exceptions
In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
next() Function and .next() Method
In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() 
function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 
as a generator method is discontinued and raises AttributeError.
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
2to3 Utility
Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. 
It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid 
Python 3.x code.
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):
def area(x,y=3.14):
a=y*x*x
print a
return a

The __future__ module
Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be 
imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use 
__future__ imports, if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the
following import statement.
from __future__ import division
The print Function
Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the print function is used. 
Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be 
suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end=' '" appends space instead of 
newline.
print x,
# Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")
# Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
Reading Input from Keyboard
Python 2 has two versions of input functions, input() and raw_input(). The input() 
function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the 
data is treated as number.
In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always 
treated as string.
In Python 2
>>> x=input('something:')
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
>>> x
10
>>> x=input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string
